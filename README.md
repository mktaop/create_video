Usa a MLLM to generate text, audio, and images and then create a video using those assets.
You need to download moviepy to use this code if you don't already have it installed. For some, the moviepy.editor may not work with most current version and in that case use the version suggested in the code. 
In my video I used a pre-written prompt for my marketing ad video, but you can change the code so the user input is required for the prompt...use st.text_input... see line #233. 
If you want to use Whisper, change the code where I am using texttospeech ... My youtube summarize video code shows you how to use Whisper. Link: https://youtu.be/bjWYpwiXjDI. 
For the Marketing ad video, i provide option for Dalle3 and Imagen3 but you can switch that out with your preference.  Both Dalle and Imagen will cost $ to generate images.
